This page summarizes key aspects of the inference model, with an emphasis on the geological assumptions encoded in the statistical framework. Users should refer to Edmonsond & Dyer (under review, *Geoscientific Model Development*) for an extended technical description of the model, guidance on choosing priors for key model parameters, synthetic proof-of-concept experiments, and advice on interpreting the results.  

Key features
=============
* 
* 

The statistical model is built using the probabilistic programming package `PyMC <https://www.pymc.io/welcome.html>`_. For users who are new to Bayesian modeling, the `PyMC documentation <https://www.pymc.io/projects/docs/en/stable/learn.html>`_ includes links to useful introductory resources.
